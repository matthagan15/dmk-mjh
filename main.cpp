            -Probability handler. Something to store a distribution and update it. Could be done in HMM.
            -An HMM class. Do we want this separate and more general, or very integrated into the robot
            -Robot class, should basically be a wrapper/storage for holding location and data,
            as well as updating location and issuing commands.
