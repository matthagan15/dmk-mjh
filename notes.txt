Gameplan:
    *Overall goal is to build a HMM controller to navigate a robot through an obstacle course.
    *Need to build:
        -Probability handler. Something to store a distribution and update it. Could be done in HMM.
        -An HMM class. Do we want this separate and more general, or very integrated into the robot
        -Robot class, should basically be a wrapper/storage for holding location and data,
        as well as updating location and issuing commands.


Transition model:
    *Class that has access to a probability distribution and robot, tells robot how to move.
    *Should probability distribution of robot location update with observations of walls?
